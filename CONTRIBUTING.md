# Contributing Guidelines

Here are a list of guidelines, from the most important (🔴), to the least important (🔵)

>   🔴 - very important  
>   🟠 - important  
>   🟡 - nice to have  
>   🟢 - you dont have to do that, your'e always welcome to  
>   🔵 - optional, but greatly appreciated :D  


🔴 No single-letter variables/functions  
🔴 Don't change any API without specifying the change  
🔴 Don't create new top-level subfolders. If subfolders are needed, place them in `vision.ds` or `vision.helpers`  
🟠 Don't use abbreviations  
🟠 Don't write module-level functions/fields exclusively. Try using classes whenever possible
🟠 Don't remove any feature if you don't give an alternative  
🟠 When heavily editing core API's (`Vision.hx`, `Image.hx`), make sure to specify your reason for editing  
🟠 Vision has a specific formatting style, specified in `hxformat.json`. Don't write code that doesn't conform to the formatting rules. It makes things look messy.  
🟡 When creating a fork, prefix your branch's name with `feature/` for a new feature, `qol/` for a QOL change/addition, `perf/` for a performance improvement, and `impr/` for an improvement upon an existing feature   
🟡 Write self-descriptive code (full variable names, does'nt matter how long they are)  
🟡 Don't write obfuscated code (even if its faster, if it isn't understandable, its hard to maintain)  
🟢 Write comments to explain your code  
🔵 Add documentation  
🔵 Extend/fix documentation
